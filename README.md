# LightFlow Tensorflow/Keras implementation
Implementation of Optical Flow predictions throught deep learning using LightFlow architecture proposed in **https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05830.pdf**

The main training procedure is based on **https://github.com/sampepose/flownet2-tf** , and the network was builded using keras Keras.

# TODOs
Error with the BatchNorm layer in Keras in training phase and inference phase

# Reference article, thanks
